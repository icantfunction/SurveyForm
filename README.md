# Affordable Care Act Interest Form

This project is a simple web form for users to express their interest in the Affordable Care Act and receive more information about healthcare coverage. The form collects basic information such as name, email, phone number, zip code, date of birth, and age.

## Files

The project consists of two main files:

1. `ACAInterestForm.html`: This is the main HTML file that contains the structure of the web form. It includes input fields for various types of information, and a submit button to submit the form.

2. `style.css`: This is the CSS file that contains the styles for the web form. It includes styles for the form elements, as well as a background image and a blur effect for the form background.

## Usage

To use this project, simply open the `ACAInterestForm.html` file in a web browser. Fill out the form fields and click the "Submit" button to submit the form.

## Customization

You can customize the look and feel of the form by modifying the `style.css` file. For example, you can change the background image by modifying the `url` in the `background-image` property for the `body` element.

## Note

This is a front-end only project. To store the form data in a database or perform other server-side operations, you'll need to implement a back-end server.
